Module 4 Coding Questions

1. 
Pull a list of customer ids with the customer’s full name, and address, along with combining their city and country together. Be sure to make a space in between these two and make it UPPER CASE. (e.g. LOS ANGELES USA)

SELECT CustomerId, FirstName || ' ' || LastName AS Fullname, 
Address, UPPER(City || ' ' || Country) AS City_State 
FROM Customers;

2. 
Create a new employee user id by combining the first 4 letters of the employee’s first name with the first 2 letters of the employee’s last name. Make the new field lower case and pull each individual step to show your work.

SELECT FirstName, SUBSTR(FirstName, 1, 4), LastName, SUBSTR(LastName, 1, 2), 
LOWER(SUBSTR(FirstName,1,4) || SUBSTR(LastName,1,2)) FROM Employees;

3.
Show a list of employees who have worked for the company for 15 or more years using the current date function. Sort by lastname ascending.

SELECT LastName, FirstName, DATE('now') - HireDate AS YearsWorked FROM Employees
WHERE YearsWorked >= 15 
ORDER BY LastName ASC;

5.
Find the cities with the most customers and rank in descending order.

SELECT City, COUNT(CustomerId) AS numberCustomers FROM Customers
GROUP BY City
ORDER BY numberCustomers DESC;

6.
Create a new customer invoice id by combining a customer’s invoice id with their first and last name while ordering your query in the following order: firstname, lastname, and invoiceID.

SELECT c.FirstName || c.LastName || i.InvoiceId AS newcustomerInvoiceId
FROM Customers AS c 
LEFT JOIN Invoices AS i 
ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
ORDER BY c.FirstName, c.LastName, i.InvoiceId;
